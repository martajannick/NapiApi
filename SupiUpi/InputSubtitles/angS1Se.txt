 They are coming 
 Atom by atom 
 They will swirl around us 
 And they will take away everything we are 
 There only one way
 to face this threat 
 Through union
 clans fighting with each other 
 that are part of our empire 
 We forgot about the Unforgettable 
 The last one to bring our tribes together 
 Kahless 
 Together connected by one thought 
 we remain Klingons 
 Therefore today
 we kindle our signal 
 To collect
 our people 
 To gather strength against those
 whose deadly greeting is:
 We come in peace 
 Isn that what Starfleet is all about 
 Hey I taught you this 
 You don trust me Captain 
 I trust your life Commander Burnham 
 that you got lost 
 Very 
 Then we both be lost 
 How much time do we have before the storm hits us 
 minutes and seconds 
 Therefore I made sure that we did not get lost 
 According to the map the well is there 
 This drought will last for years 
 Crepusculans are in danger of extinction 
 See these cocoons 
 These are their offspring 
 They survived here for over a thousand years Michael 
 they don last a thousand hours 
 the groundwater had drained them 
 we will keep the First Directive 
 And there is a well 
 You were right 
 Little faith of yours 
 I never doubted 
 How can I break through the rock 
 Explosion field seconds level 5 
 two for teleportation 
 They won detect our signatures 
 with Commander Saru we be stuck here 
 Let take a walk 
 Follow me Michael Even lines 
 It your turn to trust first 
 We really got lost 
 We're too small to notice us 
 And without a star we won set a course 
 Is it wise to move away from the village 
 my subordinate for seven years 
 about your own command 
 I am grateful Captain 
 if we had the chance
 someday return to the ship 
 Go on Michael 
 if you were stuck here for years 
 unless we die in the desert 
 But if you were alive 
 I would make contact with the natives
 and tried to fit in 
 if you were stuck here for years 
 Simple I would run away 
 These are our tracks 
 It not quite a circle 
 How did they find us 
 I set a star 
 stellar date 
 May 5 Sunday 
 U S S Shenzhou
 Federation space 
 from interstellar relays 
 do not point to anything 
 Is it an asteroid 
 to limit Fleet connectivity 
 If so who did it 
 I am hopeful 
 It hard not to be faced with such beauty 
 binary star system 
 Between two suns
 forming planets 
 which future generations will be called home 
 it is born of chaos and destruction 
 Based on the readings
 has not been damaged naturally 
 I do not like it 
 Keep looking 
 I express my concern 
 Complete the scan Express the facts 
 The bridge is yours Mr Saru 
 This is 
 Yes the first 
 The chief science officer is worried 
 Saru thinks it malicious 
 He thinks everything is malicious 
 And you what do you think What could it be 
 There is no indication that he is a thinking being 
 Technical hygiene of the Starfleet
 is exemplary 
 The federation is sending a repair ship 
 If so they have succeeded 
 Lieutenant what do we have 
 the greatest possible distance to the scan 
 some danger 
 that you suspect something wrong 
 by the first officer 
 Really 
 I shocked too 
 senior officers 
 This is 
 Is this level of sarcasm necessary 
 It is not necessary But I like it 
 There is something else there 
 Recalibration 
 It hard to locate the source 
 but no one knows what or where 
 I have it 
 Any moment Mr Saru 
 I have it 
 Magnification 
 Did it damage the relay 
 What am I looking at 
 Object of unknown origin 
 I cannot sharpen the image 
 First 
 direction 5 angle 
 located in the accretion disk 
 This is a dead zone for sensors 
 makes image processing difficult 
 As a science officer
 and deeper analysis
 But 
 optical processors 
 how to see it 
 Any ideas 
 with so little data 
 And I do 
 Lurks 
 The scattering field suggests intent 
 and we judge right away 
 Maybe he got lost 
 Is he hiding 
 So maybe he wants to be found 
 And we are speculating 
 leaving it alone 
 I don know if we have a choice 
 We cannot establish a pattern 
 for maneuvering in the ring 
 I take my jetpack 
 coming from the stars
 before her DNA unfolds like pasta 
 Like pasta 
 I be back in It just a reconnaissance maneuver 
 It is a waste of resources What will we gain from it 
 you don learn anything 
 There is no way to discover explore 
 I thought we were checking a relay 
 You're both right 
 Miss captain 
 I don want to put my friend at risk 
 And you Mr Saru 
 Do you prefer to avoid the risk 
 Always 
 that when you are in the distraction field 
 you may be cut off from communication 
 We come a long way 
 leave it unrecognized 
 Reconnaissance maneuver

 Okay 
 Twelve minutes 5 seconds 
 I have time to have a look 
 it not a shard 
 up to the maximum radiation dose 
 from the edge of the field 
 that the sculptures are crystallized souls 
 but I understand him 
 This is Burnham from a blind spot 
 I am over an object that is old 
 It has ages 
 be it a construction or a sculpture 
 that describes it well this Oh 
 But I try to be more specific 
 and with a metal exoskeleton 
 Incredibly intricate 
 The design and form are amazing 
 I wish you could see it 
 Sublime 
 Its purpose is impossible to define 
 I land and take a closer look 
 Slow and easy 
 My presence provoked some movement

 Hold on 
 Please speak up

 Please speak up 
 to Commander Burnham 
 Please speak up 
 See our brother 
 Bearer of the torch 
 killed by a Federation intruder
 on our holy signal 
 I see you 
 when you see the end
 Torch wielder
 honored us 
 He was the first to die
 on an expedition 
 which is to save us 
 Our ancestors
 they greet their fallen brother 
 Rejac

 They will be with us

 We will remain Klingons

 Sarek 
 Excuse me I will become better 
 summon the ghosts of the past 
 in present time 
 Maybe I learn Vulcan 
 to respond faster 
 Human language is not a problem 
 It your human heart 
 Well You do not sleep 
 I was dreaming 
 About what 
 About Klingons 
 How did I get here 
 We pulled you in three hours ago 
 Three hours 
 Unfinished antiproton therapy 
 What are you doing 
 There is no time 
 is not over yet 
 Go back to the antiproton chamber 
 Are you aware of the breakdown of DNA 
 You don want to die like this 
 quantum energy 
 but I don know what I grabbing 
 Again 
 What is 
 You should be in the infirmary 
 What 
 Who 
 We have to turn on the red alarm 
 Michael 
 The Klingons had hardly been seen in a hundred years 
 Check the helmet camera 
 The sensors show
 that the commander got here irradiated 
 it is life threatening 
 He was of the warrior caste 
 Klingon clan insignia 
 It not delusional 
 with concussion Philippa 
 there are Klingons 
 Red alert 
 It started 
 I pushed it onto my own blade 
 I killed him 
 a whole group of Klingons 
 If there are Klingons there 
 for damage to the relay 
 we should withdraw immediately 
 No way 
 Whatever in there must show up 
 we must scare them away 
 Aim Phase Cannons at the object 
 what belongs to a different culture 
 I didn say anything about destroying 
 Let them think we're going to attack 
 Aim at the object 
 Target set 
 Something is scanning us 
 They detected the signature of our weapon 
 Wait 
 PROXIMITY WARNING
 Impossible 
 So where did they come from 
 please disarm the phase cannon 
 First to the infirmary 
 I need you well on the bridge 
 with Starfleet 
 Send a coded message 
 Tell them we encountered Klingons 
 Shenzhou 
 Answer me 
 Shenzhou 
 From  
 say 
 It is as it was meant to be 
 Who is the successor
 Rejac 
 I am his brother 
 Or'Eq 
 Honor passes to you
 The wielder of the torch 
 With all due respect 
 There is great wisdom in your teachings 
 But 
 and the sisters will answer the call 
 Yes because the prophecy commands
 to the light of Kahless 
 when it flashes in the night sky 
 Will the ships traverse the galaxy
 because of the fairy tale 
 Do you doubt
 You disgrace
 only myself 
 I light up the signal 
 Give your name 
 Voq 
 Nobody son 
 You don have the family blade 
 You can accept
 the right of birth 
 You are not worthy 
 I am 
 No
 through the blood
 but faith 
 I serve
 the light of Kahless 
 I am born again
 from his flames 
 who lived outside
 and they want to be part of something
 greater than myself 
 the color of your skin
 as a mistake of nature 
 I call him a mirror
 because I see myself in you 
 Lord 
 detect movement 
 just as you predicted 
 Great The time has come 
 Take my blade Voq 
 Nobody son 
 it belongs to you 
 Light up the signal 
 Shenzhou 
 Answer me 
 Answer me 
 You broadcast on every channel 
 What orders 
 Nothing 
 Commander 
 I like to show you something 
 metal capsules 
 closely connected there are thousands of them 
 They form something like armor 
 This is not the best protection 
 not practical 
 Klingon biological material 
 Remote dating is divergent 
 and some hours 
 The entire ship is covered with coffins 
 Commander the captain is listening to you 
 Tell her we have to back off 
 I afraid that is no longer possible 
 there are food chains 
 In my no 
 We are a predator or a victim 
 My people were hunted 
 We were bred We are an inventory 
 for one and only one purpose:
 sense of death 
 I can sense it coming 
 The Klingon Ship is in stealth mode 
 which we have not seen yet 
 There may be more ships there 
 in every possible way 
 It looks like a trap 
 for Klingons
 and destroyed it to lure us here 
 Michael Burnham 
 Next time do not enter the area
 we haven spoken in a hundred years 
 carry out everything
 Admiral if I can 
 each interaction is a battle 
 Their hostile attitude persists 
 Federation and Klingon Empire
 they have always waged a cold war 
 we saw them fleetingly 
 about their motives 
 because that their nature 
 you should be the last person
 who judges someone by race 
 but it better not to confuse race with culture 
 within range
 Hold your position 
 Don provoke them Understand 
 Understood 
 Signal off 
 It went well 
 Only Saru speaks 
 that we should withdraw 
 there is a space station 
 on Gamma Hydra six 
 if the Klingons attack 
 Not if but when 
 I have to believe whatever going on here
 our civilizations 
 A diplomat is speaking through you 
 What does the soldier say 
 Nothing good 
 Captain on the bridge 
 High photonic activity on their ship 
 Over a billion lumens per square meter 
 Overloaded sensors 
 Energy transfer 
 Is that a weapon 
 Looks like a signal emitter 
 One hundred percent efficiency 
 Emergency shutdown 
 This noise is an electromagnetic wave 
 Adjust the orientation and dispersion 
 This is 
 The acoustics are muted 
 It is the vibration of the ship structure 
 Is he carrying a message 
 This could be a message 
 What if they are calling for what we are calling 
 Long range sensors to the maximum 
 I want to know as soon as possible 
 Are you kidding
 This is important 
 I grant 
 from every deck 
 This is 
 Activated 
 AA subspace channel 
 This frequency requires
 Voice authorization Burnham 
 Confirmed 
 Commander Burnham 
 Hello Sarek Nice to see you 
 After all those years
 you still let emotions
 influence logic 
 They inform the logic 
 I need your help 
 that the time is not accidental 
 A new star in the quadrant 
 Federation outer space 
 We stumbled upon Klingons 
 your own flesh and blood demons 
 I killed one of them 
 that they killed your parents 
 some would say it fair 
 If death was necessary
 I glad she didn touch you 
 with me for comfort 
 We stand facing each other 
 But they turned on the light signal 
 Starfleet is flying to us 
 I think they are calling for more 
 the empire has been broken for generations 
 But you are describing something unusual 
 Restraint in the face of conflict 
 against your instincts 
 or someone new 
 there are few but they do happen 
 good reason
 to gather followers 
 War 
 Be careful
 did not result from the past 
 just about what is happening now 
 diplomatic relationship with the Klingons 
 This solution is only suitable for us 
 on a human commanded ship 
 Sarek 
 Please 
 I warn you 
 handle this information carefully 
 which have already been lost 
 Tell me 
 Klingons at a distance 
 No damage inside 
 One hundred percent core 
 Hit everything we got 
 It bails out 
 zone 
 They do not pose an imminent threat 
 imminent and inevitable 
 Thank you 
 that we have fewer weapons 
 near H'Atoria
 into Klingon space 
 They destroyed the ship 
 the same error twice 
 until they established a relationship 
 they fired first 
 which the Klingons understand 
 And peace inspired respect 
 We must greet the Klingons like the Vulcans 
 he will not dissuade them from doing so 
 during our seven years together
 and implement my plan without objection 
 before we get dragged into a war 
 That it first 
 We have to 
 To my office Now 
 This is 
 Computer privacy 
 How dare you stand up to me 
 I sorry for being insubordinate 
 Don doubt them 
 They are ready for battle 
 Battle is not a simulation It blood screams 
 and funerals 
 We don shoot because of suspicion 
 And we don take innocent lives 
 I understand your Klingon story 
 it is not based on emotions 
 You're hurt 
 We will lose thousands of lives due to inaction 
 Victims of your imaginary war 
 Your Life 
 Yours 
 Give way 
 That an order 
 You're right 
 Maybe I not myself 
 Take it easy Michael 
 I sorry 
 You're free Mr Saru 
 Where the captain 
 He gives them to the admiral 
 Weapon A pair of photon torpedoes 
 calculate the target in the neck of the Klingon ship 
 Are we going to shoot the Klingons 
 if the captain had decided so 
 Are you acting in accordance with the orders of the captain 
 We operate in the face of high risk 
 and I will remove you 
 Commander this 
 and sweat on the temples 
 wishes captain 
 Take a stand Commander 
 Get out of the way Saru Tactics 
 PHOTON TORPEDA
 Fire 
 Hold the order 
 Please I trying to save you 
 I trying to save all of you 
 Give way 
 Warp signatures detected
